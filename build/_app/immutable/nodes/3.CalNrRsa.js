Bhd in Kunak, Sabah, I specialize in developing 
						intelligent systems and edge computing solutions. My work focuses on creating AI-driven applications, 
						analyzing complex systems, and implementing IoT solutions that bridge the gap between traditional 
						computing and emerging edge technologies.</p> <p class="svelte-1n8tslk">My expertise spans across artificial intelligence development, where I've created projects like 
						A.L.I.C.E (Artificial Labile Intelligence Cybernated Existence) - a REST API for AI companions, 
						and WaifuGPT - an AI chatbot with personality. These projects demonstrate my passion for creating 
						intelligent systems that can interact naturally with users.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1n8tslk">Technical Interests</h2> <p class="svelte-1n8tslk">Beyond my professional responsibilities, I'm deeply interested in the intersection of AI and edge computing. 
						I enjoy working with IoT sensors, developing mobile applications like my resin-timer-app for Android, 
						and exploring voice assistant technologies through projects like GHAWN-RED (Google Home Assistant With Node-RED).</p> <p class="svelte-1n8tslk">When I'm not coding, you'll find me watching anime, gaming, or listening to ASMR - interests that often 
						inspire creative elements in my technical projects. This blend of technical expertise and creative interests 
						helps me approach problems from unique angles and develop more engaging user experiences.</p></div> <div><div class="card"><h3>Core Values</h3> <ul class="values-list svelte-1n8tslk"><li class="svelte-1n8tslk">ðŸ¤– AI-driven innovation</li> <li class="svelte-1n8tslk">âš¡ Edge computing efficiency</li> <li class="svelte-1n8tslk">ðŸ“š Continuous learning</li> <li class="svelte-1n8tslk">ðŸŽ¯ System optimization</li> <li class="svelte-1n8tslk">ðŸ’¡ Creative problem-solving</li></ul></div> <div class="card"><h3>Interests & Focus Areas</h3> <div class="interests svelte-1n8tslk"><span class="interest-tag svelte-1n8tslk">AI Development</span> <span class="interest-tag svelte-1n8tslk">Edge Computing</span> <span class="interest-tag svelte-1n8tslk">IoT Solutions</span> <span class="interest-tag svelte-1n8tslk">System Analysis</span> <span class="interest-tag svelte-1n8tslk">Mobile Apps</span> <span class="interest-tag svelte-1n8tslk">Voice Assistants</span> <span class="interest-tag svelte-1n8tslk">Anime & Gaming</span></div></div></div></div> <div><div class="card mission-card svelte-1n8tslk"><h2 class="svelte-1n8tslk">Mission & Vision</h2> <p class="svelte-1n8tslk">My mission is to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and edge computing technologies.
